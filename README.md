# Weather-Dashboard


## Description 

This repository consists of code that creates a planner for a day's working hours (9am-5pm).

The project uses an HTML page for user interface, bootstrap and css for styling the HTML. The application uses jQuery to implement the logic. "moment.js" is used for manupulating date and time values. Local storage is used for data persistance.

When user open the planner, current date is displayed with time blocks for each working hour, starting from 9am till 5pm. Each time block is color coded. The current time block is red in color, all the past time blocks are grey and all future time blocks are green.

When user clicks on a time block, he is allowed to enter text. He can save his activity for the hour by clicking in the save button next to the time block. The value is stored in local storage and is displayed every time planner is loaded.

Git is used for version controlling and for periodic commits to Gitlab.
